        Solane's important opinions (spoilers!)
      </button>
      <p class="spoiler">I LOVE the way it mixes narrative formats. Normal books are boring asf now. But <em>Illuminae</em>, and the other two books in the series, mix notes, emails, and security footage. It just makes for such an interesting story. First book I've ever cried about.</p>

      <h2>Gemina</h2>
      <p class="desc">Another mind-bending chapter in the Illuminae Files with new protagonists.</p>

        Solane's important opinions (spoilers!)
      </button>
      <p class="spoiler">The pacing is insane. I picked it up and literally couldn't put it down. I could've sworn the book was glued to my fingertips. Even though I've read it like 600 times, I always forget about Nik and Hanna dying in their alternate universes and start bawling. Even if I remembered I would still be bawling lmao.</p>

    <div class="book-card">
      <h2>Obsidio</h2>
      <p class="desc">The finale that ties everything together in an epic showdown.</p>
      <button onclick="this.nextElementSibling.style.display='block'; this.style.display='none';">
        Solane's important opinions (spoilers!)
      </button>
      <p class="spoiler">High stakes, emotional punches, and so satisfying to see all storylines collide. Also Katya is so cute and I forgot she doesn't die, so I flipped ahead (do y'all ever do that? just flip ahead to see what happens?) and she doesn't die and then I realized I was holding my breath the entire time. Asha and Kady have the best dynamic, and I'm so happy Kaufman and Kristoff didn‚Äôt kill off anyone they weren‚Äôt supposed to. The ending is perfect (them meeting up in the restaurant and Nik bumming off Hanna? Classic) and wraps up the trilogy in a way that feels earned.</p>
