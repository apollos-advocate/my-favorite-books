        I LOVE the way it mixes narrative formats. Normal books are boring asf now. But <em>Illuminae</em>, and the other two books in the series, mix notes, emails, and security footage. It just makes for such an interesting story. First book I've ever cried about. Can you guess the other two?

        The pacing is insane. I picked it up and literally couldn't put it down. Even though I've read it like 600 times, I always forget about Nik and Hanna dying with each other in their alternate universes and start bawling. Even if I remembered, I would still be bawling lmao.

        High stakes, emotional punches, and so satisfying to see all storylines collide. Asha and Kady have the best dynamic, and I was so stressed reading this book. But the ending? Perfect. Them meeting up in the restaurant, and Nik bumming off of Hanna? Chef's kiss.
