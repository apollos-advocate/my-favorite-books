    <h2>Illuminae</h2>
      <p class="desc">A sci-fi story told through hacked documents, chats, and schematics.</p>

      <p class="spoiler">I just LOVE the way it mixes narrative formats. Normal books are boring asf now. But <em>Illuminae</em> and the other two books mix notes, emails, and security footage. Only three books have ever made me cry, this is one of them. Can you guess the other two?</p>

      <p class="spoiler">The pacing is insane. Even though I've read it like 600 times, I still bawl at Nik and Hanna’s scenes every single time. Alternate universe deaths? Yeah, that broke me. Shattered.</p>

      <h2>Obsidio</h2>
      <p class="desc">The finale that ties everything together in an epic showdown.</p>
      <button class="spoiler-btn">Show Solane’s Opinions</button>
      <p class="spoiler">High stakes, emotional punches, and so satisfying to see all storylines collide. The ending made me feel like I earned it.</p>
