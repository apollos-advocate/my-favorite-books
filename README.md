# Solane’s Favorite Books

Hi there! This is a little personal website I made to share my very important opinions about my favorite books.

# What’s here?

A list of books I love (shoutout to the *Illuminae Files* trilogy ) with descriptions and spoilers you can click to reveal. I wanted something fun + simple to show off my coding journey.  

# Live site
Check it out here: https://apollos-advocate.github.io/my-favorite-books 

# Tech used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- A lot of trial and error 

# Why?
This is one of my first projects as I’m learning web development. I’ll keep improving it as I learn more.
